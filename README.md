This repository includes an HTML file (https://plana-ripoll.github.io/NB-COMO/) created with R markdown in order to replicate the analyses performed on the following paper:

Plana-Ripoll et al. The pervasive nature of comorbidity within mental disorders: a comprehensive, nationwide cohort study. JAMA Psychiatry. In press.

In this paper, we estimated the association between 90 pairs of mental disorders. In this document, the R code for one specific pair is provided: the association between Mood Disorders (as a prior-disorder) and Neurotic Disorders (as a later-disorder).
